        "prediction": "2.2x1014kg\n\nTo find the mass of the Martian atmosphere, we first need to calculate its volume. We can use the formula for the volume of a sphere, V = 4/3πr³, where r is the radius of Mars. Given that the surface area of Mars is about 145000000 square km, we can find the radius using the formula for the surface area of a sphere, A = 4πr². Solving for r, we get r = √(A/(4π)).\n\nOnce we have the radius, we can calculate the volume of the atmosphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere. Then, we can use the formula P = ρg, where P is the atmospheric pressure, ρ is the density of the atmosphere, and g is the acceleration due to gravity, to solve for the density of the atmosphere. Finally, we can use the formula M = ρV to find the mass of the atmosphere. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nM = (600 Pa / (4 m/s²)) * (145000000 km²) * (10⁶ m",
