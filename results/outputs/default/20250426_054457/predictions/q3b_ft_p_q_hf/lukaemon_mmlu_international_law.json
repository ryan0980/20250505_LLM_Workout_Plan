        "prediction": "3 There is no priority among international courts and tribunals since there is no lis pendens or priority rule. According to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the International Court has exclusive jurisdiction to settle disputes arising from treaties concluded after the adoption of the convention. Since the convention was adopted by the General Assembly, the court cannot be prejudiced by the existence or otherwise of a lis pendens situation. Therefore, the answer is A. Answer: A. Since the International Court of Justice has exclusive jurisdiction, there is a priority among the various organs of the United Nations Security Council. The Security Council has exclusive power to refer disputes referred to the Permanent Body (the General Committee), and the Permanent Committee of the General Conference of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Furthermore, the Permanent Committee of the General Conference of the United Nations Economic and Economic Council of the General Conference of the United Nations Economic and Economic Council of the General Conference of the United Nations Economic and Economic Council of the General Conference of the United Nations Economic and Economic Council of the General Conference of the United Nations General Conference of the General Conference and the General Committee (Permanent Committee).
