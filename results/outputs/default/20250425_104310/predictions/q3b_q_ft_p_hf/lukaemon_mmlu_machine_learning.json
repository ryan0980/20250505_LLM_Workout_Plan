In the classification task, the aim is to map the input data to discrete categories. What type of task is a classification task usually considered to be part of? 1) Classification task or 2) Regression task?\nSuppose that a classification task is performed on a dataset consisting of 100000000000000000 (a hypothetical number), which task will likely generalize better to new instances: 1) A classifier built solely on supervised",
