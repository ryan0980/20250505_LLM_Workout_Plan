Photons act as waves and interact with matter in a diffraction pattern.\n2. Waves propagate through a vacuum but interact strongly with particles.\n3. Wave-particle duality applies only to electrons, never photons.\n4. Wave-particle duality is a concept discovered by Einstein.\n5. Waves act as particles and interact with particles in predictable ways.\n6. Waves act as waves and interact with particles in a predictable way.\n7. Waves act as waves interacting with particles and interact in a predictable way. To determine wave-particle duality correctly among the options, we need to identify which statement accurately describes wave-particle duality. Wave-particle duality refers to the property of waves and particles that allow them to interact and exhibit both wave and particle behavior. Among the given options, the correct answer for wave-particle duality would be:\n\nWave-particles act as waves and interact with particles in a diffraction pattern.\n\nThis aligns best with the idea presented in the wave-particle dualism, where waves represent the wave-like properties and particles represent the corpuscular (particulate) properties.
