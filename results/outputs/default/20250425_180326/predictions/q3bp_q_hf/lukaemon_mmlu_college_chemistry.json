The correct option among the choices provided would be:\nThe I− : IO3− ratio is 3:1. This corresponds to the first option, since the ratio of I- to IO3− ions is 3:1, meaning there are more I- ions compared to IO3− ions.\n\nHere's another possible correct option among the ones provided, corresponding to the correct ratio of 3:1:\n\nC. The MnO4- + I- + H+ -> Mn2+ + I- (the reaction occurs due to the presence of permanganate)\n\nSo, among the provided options, the correct answer is indeed \"I- : IO3− = 3:1\" or simply \"I-\".\n\nAnd the correct ratio for the given reaction is indeed 3:1, meaning that the correct option among the ones provided is indeed \"I-\".\nAnswer: C.

Express the splitting in units of mT, Gauss and cm-1.\nA. 15.5 MHz = 11.104 mT = 27.201 Gauss = 0.862 x 10^-4 cm-1\nB. 15.5 MHz = 7.352 mT = 10.104 Gauss = 18.39 x 10^-4 cm-1\nC. 15.5 MHz = 1.55 mT = 0.562 Gauss = 31.0 x 10^-4 cm-1\nD. 15.5 MHz = 0.553 mT = 5.530 Gauss = 5.17 x 10^-4 cm-1\nAnswer: ",
        "prediction": "1.55 mT\nThe splitting is due to the Zeeman effect, which occurs because the electron wavefunction splits due to the presence of a magnetic field.

Large and positive g shifts are observed when the LUMO – HOMO gap is small and λ is positive.\nB. Large deviations in g occurs when the energy difference between the SOMO and lowest lying excited state is large.\nC. A large deviation of g from ge is expected when λ is large and the energy difference between the SOMO and the lowest lying excited state is small.\nD. A small deviation of g from ge is expected when λ is small and positive.\nAnswer: ",
        "prediction": "3. A small deviation of g from ge is expected. \n\nThe correct answer is A. A small deviation of g from ge is expected.\n\nExplanation: The L-S (Lichtenberg figure) is a visualization technique that helps chemists visualize the electronic structure of a molecule. In this technique, the Lichtenberg figure shows the distribution pattern of the L-S (S-S) interaction energy. The interaction energy is proportional to the L-S interaction strength, which is represented by the g value. A small deviation from ge (the lowest possible g) would mean a larger interaction strength, implying a higher L-S interaction and thus a larger interaction energy.\n\nBased on the given options, the correct statement is:\n\nA. A small deviation of g from ge is expected.\n\nThis means the interaction strength (interaction energy) is proportional to the interaction strength, meaning a smaller deviation from ge (a larger interaction strength due to a larger g) implies a lower interaction energy.\n\nWhich one of these statements correctly describes the interaction strength (interaction energy) relative to the lowest possible interaction strength (ge)? Answer: A. A small deviation of g from ge is expected.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nA. A small deviation is expected for the interaction strength relative to the lowest possible interaction strength. B.",
